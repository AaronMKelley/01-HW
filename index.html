<p class="para"> I am originally from Upstate NY and went to school at SUNY Geneseo. I have only older brother and all of my family all lives in Rochester,NY. For the last 3 years I have been working at Airbnb on the Public Policy team. There I work with city governments in order to hopefully pass legislation that will continue to allow our platform to operate.  </p>
<br/>

<p class="para">In college I was on the rowing team and sat 7th seat in an eight man boat. Rowing is a tough sport because it requires you to get up really early in the morning (around 4am) before classe and when the water is the least likely to be choppy. It is also very difficult because there is no off season. In the fall there are "Head Races" which are long and do not have you racing boats side to side, but instead trying to beat each others time. Each boat starts one after each other, hence "head to toe". Then the winer comes and you and you still have practice 6 days a week indoors(if it is too cold or there is snow and ice) on indoor rowing machines called "ergs". Then comes the spring sprints. These are the shorter more intense races where the boats do line up all together and actively race each other. Since moving to the bay area I have not joined a local club, but wish to.</p>
<br/>
<p class="para">When I am not working (and now not in class or studying) you can often find me at the movies seeing the latest film or hanging with friends at a local park or a popular restuarant Work also gets me out of the city often and I mostly travel to San Diego where I have recently taken up surfing. Being 6' 4" inches and surly made learning to surf difficult, but the rush that you get from hitting the right way and keeping yourself up is hard to replicate. I try and get out on the water every trip that I can.</p>
